# predict-IPO-with-machine-learning

when a company decides to make an IPO is a crucial moment.
success or failure? life or death?

what if it were possible to develop a machine learning model that could predict what will happen after the IPO?

i tried to create it. could i have succeeded?

## BEFORE START

this is a build in public project.
what it means?
I'm at the start of my journey and i want to improve my skill constantly.
I created a first model with various strengths and weaknesses and as time goes by I will improve my skills by creating an ever better models.
Each model created will remain published in this repository to document my growth and the growth of this project.

WHY THIS PROJECT?

1. improve my coding skill in Python
2. improve my data science and machine learning skill
3. apply the financial analysis skills learned during my studies
4. understand how to automate the  financial statements analysis with python
5. more important: understand if it is possible to predict success or failure of a company IPO

technology used: Python,YahooFinance Api

If you are interested in more information about the project, want to contribute or want to give me advice, please contact me.

ok, I'm done. we can start
